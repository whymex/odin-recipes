            <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 can (14 ounces/400g) crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 can (6 ounces/170g) tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups (475ml) ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups (225g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (50g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (10g) fresh basil leaves, chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, sautéing until the onion becomes translucent and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until browned, breaking it up into small pieces with a spoon or spatula. Drain any excess fat.</li>
            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and half of the shredded mozzarella cheese. Mix well until evenly blended.</li>
            <li>Assemble the lasagna by spreading a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch (23x33cm) baking dish. Place three lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping them. Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture on top, followed by another layer of the meat sauce. Sprinkle a generous amount of grated Parmesan cheese over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers, starting with the lasagna noodles, until you've used all the ingredients. Make sure to end with a layer of meat sauce and sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 15 minutes or until the cheese turns golden and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes to set. Garnish with freshly chopped basil leaves, if desired, before serving.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve the lasagna while it's still warm, savoring the melding flavors and layers of pasta, cheese, and sauce. Pair it with a crisp green salad and garlic bread for a complete and satisfying meal.</li>
        </ol>
