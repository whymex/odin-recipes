    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound (450g) pizza dough</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120ml) pizza sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups (225g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Assorted toppings of your choice (e.g., pepperoni, sliced bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, onions)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves, torn (optional, for garnish)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature recommended for your pizza dough (usually around 475°F/245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
            <li>On a floured surface, roll out the pizza dough into your desired shape and thickness. If you prefer a thin crust, roll it out thinner; for a thicker crust, leave it slightly thicker.</li>
            <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough onto a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Spoon the pizza sauce onto the dough and spread it evenly, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, ensuring even coverage.</li>
            <li>Add your desired toppings, distributing them evenly across the pizza.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the olive oil over the toppings, and sprinkle the dried oregano, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes (if desired) on top.</li>
            <li>If using a pizza stone, carefully slide the pizza from the peel onto the preheated stone in the oven. If using a baking sheet, place the sheet directly in the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust turns golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Garnish with torn fresh basil leaves, if desired.</li>
            <li>Slice your homemade pizza into wedges or squares, and serve it hot, savoring the delightful combination of flavors and textures.</li>
        </ol>
